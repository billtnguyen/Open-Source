# Open-Source

The aspect of Open Source that I found interesting is the collaboration between programmers that’s working on software without asking permission to use a software that can be
associated with intellectual property. It’s fascinating to learn that the idea of anyone in the world can contribute to a program at the cost of nobody claims ownership of that
program. I’ve learned that the Richard Stallman, the founding father of the Free Software movement and built the GNU operating system, has formed the foundation of the Free
Software movement which is a major part of Open Source. It’s interesting to know that Microsoft was the pioneers of the idea of software intellectual property which goes against
the idea of Open Source. Richard Stallman has said in his interview, 
> “if a programmer wants to fix code on a program, the programmer must get permission from the company to give
him access to the locked program even though it’s beneficial for the company.”

In the early 1980s, when a person wants to get the modern computer in the 80s, they would have to
get a proprietary operating system which would limit the person to not share code with other people. This event would lead Richard Stallman to help build the GNU operating system
so that a community of programmers would share code with each other. Free Software enables a user to modify a software freely in a short amount of time while also creating a
community to help other users modify their own programs. I learned that if a Free Software gets put into a public domain, a person can change the software and turn it into their
own proprietary software which would prevent the other users to share code with each other. To prevent this, a technique called copy left would copyright the software and the
owner of the software gives the user permission to change and add the code to the software. But when a user redistributes the software, the person getting the redistributed
software also gets the permission to change and add code to the software. This would help build cooperation and a community that would help change codes to software. An example
that used the technique is the GNU General Public License which Richard Stallman wrote. Linux has used this as its license for their users. The ideas for making money from Free
Software has been created in The GNU Manifesto. It entails of the advantages of Free Software which was the free market of services. If a person was using a software and was
looking for good support on their software, they would have several options to choose the support that they would prefer and would encourage each people that do services or
support to have the best service. With proprietary software, there is only one support because the company has the only source code, and the user would have to use their support
whether they want to or not which would not encourage for improvement. It’s interesting to see how Open Software can affect how much freedom a user can have with their software
and how it affects with their decisions with the software, and how much they learn how to modify their software.
